Description: Filtering of lowly expressed features (e.g. genes) is a common
    step before performing statistical analysis, but an arbitrary threshold is
    generally chosen. SeqGate implements a method that rationalize this step by
    the analysis of the distibution of counts in replicate samples. The gate is
    the threshold above which sequenced features can be considered as
    confidently quantified.
